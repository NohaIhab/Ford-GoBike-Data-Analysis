# Ford-GoBike-Data-Analysis
This data set includes information about individual rides made through Ford GoBike, a bike-sharing
system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area including duration, user type, start time,
whether they bike-shared through the trip, and more.
In the exploration, I found out that there were less users of the service on weekends than on
weekdays. Secondly, It was clear from the data that most people who use the service are
Subscribers, and a much smaller percentage are customers. Then, I discovered that the peak hour for
the bike share is at 8 am, followed by 5 pm. Afterwards, I discovered that no customers bike share
for all trip. During multivariate exploration, the most interesting reveal is that subscribers tend to
cycle for a lower average duration than customers do.
In the explanatory analysis, I focused on the key findings from the exploration. These were the ratio
of user types, the relation of user type to duration, and the most common start hour for cycling.

The notebook was created as a final project submission for Udacity's Advanced Data Analysis Course.
